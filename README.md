    Yellowed
</h3>

---

> [!NOTE]
> Yellowed is a simple material dark theme wich focus his syntax color on the golden yellow. Its syntax is inspired by the [gruber-darker](https://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme) theme for emacs, but changed a bit. The interface color is clearly stealed (maybe not :p) from the [Accent Monokai](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tw.monokai-accent) theme, the blue one.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you find any weird syntax highlighting, please report it [here](https://github.com/Gael-Lopes-Da-Silva/YellowedVSCode/issues/new/choose). This would help me a lot since I can't cover all the languages.
