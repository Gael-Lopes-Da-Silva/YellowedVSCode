> Yellowed is a simple material dark theme wich focus his syntax color on the golden yellow. Its syntax is inspired by the [gruber-darker](https://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme) theme for emacs, but changed a bit.

<!-- > [!IMPORTANT] -->
> ‚ùó
> If you find any weird syntax highlighting, try disabling semantic highlighting. If it doesn't work then please report it [here](https://github.com/Gael-Lopes-Da-Silva/YellowedVSCode/issues/new/choose). This would help me a lot since I can't cover all the languages.
