<h3 align="center">Yellowed</h3>

<p align="center">‚öôÔ∏è Yellowed is a simple material dark theme for Visual Studio Code wich focus his syntax color on the golden yellow. Its syntax is inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme">gruber-darker</a> theme for emacs, but changed a bit. The interface color is clearly stealed (maybe not :p) from the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tw.monokai-accent">Accent Monokai</a> theme, the blue one.</p>

<p align="center">‚ö†Ô∏è If you find any weird syntax highlighting, please report it on the <a href="https://github.com/Gael-Lopes-Da-Silva/Yellowed">github</a> or the <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gael-Lopes-Da-Silva/Yellowed">gitlab</a> page. This would help me a lot since I can't cover all the languages.</p>
