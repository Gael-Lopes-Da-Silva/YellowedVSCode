    :gear: Yellowed is a simple material dark theme wich focus his syntax color on the golden yellow. Its syntax is inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/rexim/gruber-darker-theme">gruber-darker</a> theme for emacs, but changed a bit. The interface color is clearly stealed (maybe not :p) from the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tw.monokai-accent">Accent Monokai</a> theme, the blue one.

    :exclamation: If you find any weird syntax highlighting, please report it <a href="https://github.com/Gael-Lopes-Da-Silva/YellowedVSCode/issues/new/choose">here</a>. This would help me a lot since I can't cover all the languages.
